## A funny story
When growing up part of being a big brother was finding unique and humourous ways to torment your younger siblings. One such occasion was on a family holiday to Gran Canaria. My brother who was only 8 years old at the time, had remarked with confusion about a Rastafarian man's dreadlocked hair and asked "why do they look so different?", I explained to him that, "it was a cultural practice but that the hair wasnt the main thing he should worry about and that he should keep a distance as they eat children". Mylittle brother and sister looked at each other with disbelief, only to have one man that overheard us play along and say "Mmmm Delicious children!" causing them to scream and run away.
### TL;DR
Big brothers can be mean
